    <p class="glimpse"><strong>Glimpse:</strong> Large photos for print need careful resizing to maintain detail and colour. This guide walks you through lossless resizing, sharpening, colour profile tips, and export settings — plus quick tools like EasyImageCR.in to prepare images for web and social.</p>

    <section class="content">
      <h2>Story</h2>
      <p>Neha had a beautiful landscape shot taken on a high-resolution camera. She wanted a framed print for her living room but when she resized the image the printed result looked soft and slightly off-colour. She wasn’t sure which settings to change and worried about losing detail.</p>

      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>Resizing for print is not the same as resizing for the web. Web images focus on file size and fast loading; prints require correct pixel dimensions (DPI), colour profile (CMYK vs sRGB depending on the lab), and careful resampling to avoid softening or artifacts.</p>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Check the target size and DPI:</strong> Know the physical print size (in inches or cm) and the printer’s DPI. For quality prints, 300 DPI is standard; for large posters 150–200 DPI may be acceptable.</li>
        <li><strong>Calculate pixel dimensions:</strong> Multiply inches × DPI. For a 12×8 inch print at 300 DPI: 3600×2400 px.</li>
        <li><strong>Work from the largest file:</strong> Start from the original full-resolution file (never upsample smaller files unless necessary).</li>
        <li><strong>Use the right resampling method:</strong> Use a high-quality algorithm — “Bicubic Sharper” for downsizing in Photoshop, or Lanczos in image processors. Avoid basic nearest-neighbour or aggressive compression.</li>
        <li><strong>Apply light sharpening:</strong> After resizing, apply subtle unsharp mask (radius 0.6–1.0, amount 30–60%) to restore perceived sharpness lost during resampling.</li>
        <li><strong>Convert/Embed colour profile:</strong> Ask your print lab: many accept sRGB, some want Adobe RGB or CMYK. Convert only when required and embed the profile in the exported file.</li>
        <li><strong>Export as high-quality TIFF or max-quality JPEG:</strong> For archival/print use TIFF (lossless) or high-quality JPEG (quality 90–100). Avoid heavy compression.</li>
      </ol>

      <div class="pro-tip">💡 <strong>Pro Tip 1:</strong> Always keep the original raw/PSD; make edits on a copy so you can return to the master if needed.</div>
      <div class="pro-tip">💡 <strong>Pro Tip 2:</strong> Resize in two small steps (e.g., 90% then 80%) only if a single-step resize softens the image — this can sometimes preserve more detail.</div>
      <div class="pro-tip">💡 <strong>Pro Tip 3:</strong> Soft-proof in Photoshop (View → Proof Setup) to preview how colours will look when printed; tweak before export.</div>

      <h2>Example</h2>
      <p>Example: A 24×16 inch wall print at 200 DPI needs 4800×3200 px. If your camera file is 8000×5333, resize down using Bicubic/Lanczos, apply light sharpening, and export as TIFF. If sending as JPEG to a lab, export at quality 95 with embedded sRGB or Adobe RGB per lab guidance.</p>

      <h3>Mini FAQ</h3>
      <dl class="faq">
        <dt>Can I simply increase JPG resolution to print larger?</dt>
        <dd>No — upsampling small images generally reduces quality. Use AI upscalers sparingly and prefer original larger files.</dd>
        <dt>Which is better for print: TIFF or JPEG?</dt>
        <dd>TIFF is lossless and preferred for professional prints. High-quality JPEGs (quality 90–100) are acceptable for many labs and smaller budgets.</dd>
        <dt>How does colour profile affect prints?</dt>
        <dd>Colour profiles control how colours map between devices. If unsure, ask your printer which profile they prefer and embed it in your exported file.</dd>
